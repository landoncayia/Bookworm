# Bookworm

A basic iOS app used to track the books a person has read along with their thoughts of them.

## Installing / Getting started

This app is not on the App Store, so you will not be able to find it there. If you wish to run it, you will need to clone this repository on a Mac with Xcode and the iPhone Simulator installed. Please ensure that your Simulator runs iOS 15 or later.

## Features

* Keep track of books you have read
* Stores title, author, genre, review, and star rating
* Tap on a book to see its details
* Delete books by swiping, using edit button, or trash can on detail view

## Credit

The idea for this project came from Paul Hudson's *100 Days of SwiftUI*. I may eventually add to this code, but credit for the base code goes to Paul Hudson. Links to each day on which material is referenced may be found below:
